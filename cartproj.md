## Final Project: The Sendero Pacifico Trail Network

To apply all the foundational skills learned over a semester of Cartographic design, I decided to further my work for the World Trails Network this past January by creating a beautiful, stylized, tourist map of the trail. My main focus was to create a background from a hillshade created by a Digital Elevation Model, that could also be stylized and filled in using artistic techniques as well. I not only ran the standard hillshade workflow model in GEE or Blender, but then I also spent numerous hours in both Photoshop and Illustrator perfecting a lush, green landscape.
