/* Lab 6: Dar Es Salaam floodplain analysis with SQL*/ 
/* Using data from OpenStreetMaps, Ramania Huria (http://ramanihuria.org/), Resilience Academy (https://resilienceacademy.ac.tz/), we crafted SQL code that first creates a floodplain derived from OSM wetlands, and then subscribed area of subwards to determine which subwards had higher risk of flooding via percent area in the floodplain. */
