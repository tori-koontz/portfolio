## Welcome to Tori's GIS Portfolio!

On this page are various projects I have completed throughout various classes in Geography and GIS at Middlebury College. 



### Spring 2019: Human Geography in GIS 

How do geographers study spatial interactions between people, society, and the environment? How do factors like race, ethnicity, age, and income relate to spatial cognition, movement, settlement, and social organization? How can geographic information systems (GIS) help geographers describe, understand, and explain these spatial patterns and processes? In this course we learned applications of GIS in human geography from local to global scales. Readings and case studies introduced and contextualized methods for using mental maps, big data, regional statistics, and network models for inquiries of gerrymandering, gentrification, spatial justice, and other topics. We learned to gather geographic evidence, conduct analyses with GIS, and critically present results with cartographic layouts.

2. [Segregation through Surface Temperatures in Houston, TX](houston.md)


### Fall 2019: Open Source GIS 

In GEOG323, students examined geographic information science (GIS) with open-source software and critical GIS scholarship. Through weekly labs, we practiced techniques such as: data acquisition and preparation for analysis, spatial SQL database queries, automating analysis, spatial interpolation, testing sensitivity to error and uncertainty, and data visualization.

1. [Global Digital Elevation Models](lab3.md)

    1.2 [DEM cont. with Batch Script Processing](lab4.md)

2. [Urban Resilience in Dar Es Salaam](lab6.md)

3. [Reproducibility Concerns: Malawi lab](lab8_malawi.md)

4. [Activity Hotspots on Twitter during Hurricane Dorian](lab10twitter.md)


### World Trails Network: Sendero PÃ¡cifico 

During January 2020, I was an intern for WTN- Hub for the Americas. I was tasked with creating an interactive web map of the entire trail network. The map is still under construction! I am testing it on this page

### Spring 2020: Cartographic Design 

Coming soon!
