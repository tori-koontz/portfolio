## Lab 3: Global Digital Elevation Models 

This week in lab, we used digital elevation model data to analyze various terrain outputs, such as a map of the hydrology network on Mt. Kilimanjaro, using SAGA.

As a first step, we access either ASTER or SRTM data from www.earthdata.nasa.gov . I decided to use SRTM data and selected data from the two tiles containg Mt. Kilimanjaro, identified by lower left coordinates S03E037 and s04E037. I downloaded the two files and opened them using SAGA. 

Once in SAGA, I ran the Mosaicking tool in order to create4 one, smooth image combining the two data files.
