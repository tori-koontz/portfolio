## Welcome to Tori's GIS Portfolio!

On this page are various projects I have completed throughout various classes in Geography and GIS at Middlebury College. 



### Fall 2019: Open Source GIS 

In GEOG323, students examined geographic information science (GIS) with open-source software and critical GIS scholarship. Through weekly labs, we practiced techniques such as: data acquisition and preparation for analysis, spatial SQL database queries, automating analysis, spatial interpolation, testing sensitivity to error and uncertainty, and data visualization.
