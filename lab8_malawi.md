## Resilience and Reproducibility: Malawi as a case study 

Over the course of two weeks, our class discussed critical ideas of reproducibility and replicability in GIS/data science work. In order to contribute to a fully open source data science world, new published work should strive to accomplish these two goals, so that their research may be redone or reanalyzed by interested parties. We tested this idea of reproducibility through Malcolm et. al'w work, ["Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622814000058?via%3Dihub). Our goal in this lab was to use Malcolm's methodology in order to recreate his map of vulnerability.
