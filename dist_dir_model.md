You can access my Distance and Direction model for QGIS [here](DistDir_modelUPDATED.model3)

Additionally, you can see plots for both the [distance] (Boston_Dir_plot.html) and [direction] (Boston_Dir_plot.html) in relation to rent prices in the Boston Metro area, created using the model and executed with Data Plotly.
