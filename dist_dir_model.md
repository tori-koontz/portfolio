You can access my Distance and Direction model for QGIS [here](DistDir_modelUPDATED.model3)

Additionally, you can see plots for both the [distance](Boston_Dist_plot.html) and [direction](Boston_Dir_plot.html) in relation to rent prices in the Boston Metro area, created using the model and executed with Data Plotly. 

For my data, I used the following [geopackage](BostonMetro_tracts.gpkg), which features U.S. Census data for the Boston Metro area, including Median Gross Rent from 2017 and totals of Latinx population.
